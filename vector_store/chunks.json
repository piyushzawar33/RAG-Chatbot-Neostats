        "text": "Our audience is largely wannabe entrepreneurs in India. And I feel like all of us have so much to learn from you because you've done it so many times over in so many different domains. So, we will speak to them today, and I will try and centre all my questions in that direction so they can take advantage of this conversation and maybe start-- take a chance and build something. Do you want a coffee? Um... -Sure, why not? -Okay. Are we gonna be talking for a while? -[laughs] -I hope we are. Okay, good. Sure. -Um... -Meghana? May I trouble you for a coffee? Can we get another coffee? -[Meghana] Anything's fine? -Uh... Cappuccino, I guess. [Meghana] Cappuccino? Okay. Are you a coffee drinker, Elon? -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah? Yeah, I have a coffee once, -usually in the mornings. -Okay. -One-a-day kind of thing? -Yeah, pretty much. You want to wait for it? No, I'm good. [laughter] The first thing I must say is you're a lot bigger and bulkier, muscular, On X, text vs video, how people communicate than I would have thought you are. Oh, stop, you're making me blush. Really. Seriously. Yeah, I mean, look, on the Internet, I'm small, you know? You're essentially... What percentage of Internet is spent on Twitter? Is there a number to it? On X. Well, so, we have, like, about 600 million monthly users. Although, it can spike up, if there's some major event in the world. It can get up to, I don't know, 800 million or a billion, if there's some major event in the world, so... I don't know, 250 to 300 million per week type of thing. It's a pretty decent number. It tends to be readers, you know, people that read words. You know, so... Do you think that'll change? Yeah, I mean, there's... There's certainly a lot of video on the X system. But at this point... Increasing amounts of video. But I think where the X network is strongest is among people who think a lot and read a lot. You know, so, that's where it's gonna be strongest. Because we have words. And, you know, so... Among readers, writers, and thinkers, I think X is number one in the world. As far as social media goes, the form factor, if you had to wager a guess for tomorrow... -Yeah. -...how much is text, how much is video? I've heard you speak about maybe voice and hearing being the next form of communication with AI. What happens to X in its true form? How does it evolve? Yeah, so, I do think most interaction is gonna be video in the future. Most interactions are gonna be real-time video with AI. So, real-time video comprehension, real-time video generation, that's gonna be most of the load. And that's how it is for most of the Internet right now. Most of the Internet is video. Text is a pretty small percentage. But the text tends to",

And that's how it is for most of the Internet right now. Most of the Internet is video. Text is a pretty small percentage. But the text tends to be higher value, generally. Or more, it's more densely compressed information. Yeah, so... But if you say what is the most amount of bits generated and compute spent, it's certainly gonna be video. So, I used to be a shareholder of X, -a very small one. -Okay. And I got paid when you bought Twitter and you made it X. -Happy decision? Glad you did it? -Yeah, yeah, I think it was important. You know, I felt like Twitter was heading in... or had gone in a direction that had more of a negative influence on the world. It was... I mean, of course, this depends on one's perspective. Some people will say, well, actually, they liked the way it was, and now, they don't like it. But I think the fundamental thing was that... Twitter was amplifying... I would say, a fairly pretty far left by most people's standards in the world's ideology because of where it was based, in San Francisco. And then they actually suspended a lot of people on the right. So, from their perspective, even someone in the centre would be far right. If you're far left, anyone in the centre is far right, because... It's just on the political spectrum, they're just as far left as you get in the United States and in San Francisco. So, what I've tried to do is just restore it to be balanced and centrist. So, there haven't been any left-wing voices that have been suspended or banned or de-amplified or anything like that. Now, some of them have chosen to just go somewhere else, but... But at this point, the operating principle of the X system is to adhere to any country's laws, but not to put our thumb on the scale beyond the laws of a country. When I think of social media... -Oh, thank you. -Thank you. Collective consciousness When I think of social media, Elon, I feel like... even data suggests that the current incumbents seem to be losing traction amongst the youngest of audience. Yeah. Even platforms like Instagram... I mean, they're not exactly like Twitter, but platforms across the board. If one had to rework social media and build something bottom-up, what do you think would work for the world of tomorrow? Well, I mean, I don't think that much about... about social media, to be frank. I mean, it's... I mostly just wanna have something where there's... in the case of X, kind of a global town square, where people can say what they wanna say with words, pictures, video... where there's a secure messaging system. We've recently added the ability to do audio and video calls. So, really trying to",
